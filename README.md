# SomeTeams

This is a website made as part of an assignment in the PHP-course at Yrgo. The task was to display a selection of women's football teams from a data-file.

The live URL of the project is: https://filiplyrheden.se/SomeTeams/

I started creating a simple HTML table and made sure I had a basic structure for displaying the data for one of the teams. 

Then I moved on to write a foreach-loop to display all teams in the table.

I wanted to display the teams as a list sorted by UEFA-ranking, which proved to be the most difficult part for me during this project. I had to figure out a way to sort the data by a specific key in the array. As well as finding a way to handle that two of the teams are listed as "Not ranked". 

With the teams listed and ranked the way I wanted to I applied some styling with CSS and â€“ having used a HTML table for layout - wrote some media queries to make it (sort of) responsive for smaller display sizes. 

To conclude I really enjoyed the project and learned a lot. Next time I'm pretty sure I'll give the design and layout some more thought and planning in advance, instead of doing so much experimenting and trial and error in the code editor.
