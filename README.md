# SomeTeams

A website made for an assignment in the PHP-course at Yrgo. The task was to display a visualize data containing information about women's football teams.

The live URL of the project is: https://filiplyrheden.se/SomeTeams/

I started by creating a simple HTML table and made sure I had a basic structure for displaying the data for one of the teams. 

Then I moved on to write a foreach-loop to display all teams in the table.

I wanted to display the teams as a list sorted by UEFA-ranking, which proved to be the most difficult part for me during this project. I had to figure out a way to sort the data by a specific key in the array. As well as finding a way to handle that two of the teams were listed as "Not ranked". 

With the teams listed and ranked the way I wanted to I applied some styling with CSS and â€“ having used a HTML table for layout - went on to write some media queries to make the design (sort of) responsive for smaller display sizes. 

I really enjoyed the project and learned a lot. Next time I'm pretty sure I will give the design and layout some more thought and planning in advance, instead of doing as much experimenting and trial and error in the code editor.
